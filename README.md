# Python OOP Assignment 

This repository contains solutions for an **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) assignment** in Python.  
The tasks explore **classes, constructors, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism**.

---

## Assignment Tasks

Activity 1: Design Your Own Class
- Designed a `Smartphone` class with attributes (`brand`, `model`, `storage`, `battery_life`).
- Added methods like `call()` and `charge()`.
- Used a constructor to initialize objects with unique values.
- Implemented **inheritance** with a `GamingPhone` subclass that adds a `play_game()` method.

 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge
- Implemented a `Vehicle` base class with a `move()` method.
- Created subclasses:
  - `Car` → "Driving "
  - `Plane` → "Flying "
  - `Boat` → "Sailing "
- Demonstrated **polymorphism** by calling `move()` on different objects.
